Rules:
PERCENTILE USERS DEALING WITH PODES: Note that for this to be effective at a district level you still need to make a pivot table that sums all the variables at the district level!
Make sure input does not have any extra space or variables outside of what you need
If you want to reuse the program make sure the output csv is closed or else nothing will happen
